# Shake, Rattle, and Roll

## Introduction
One of the most common things to do with JavaScript is HTML Manipulation or changing HTML after it has been loaded.

## Objective
In this lab, you will use what you have learned about JavaScript variables and HTML Manipulation to make the box Shake, Rattle, and Roll. 

## Requirements
Follow the requirements below to successfully complete the assignment.

1. Download the [Shake, Rattle and Roll starter files](https://github.com/MTM6230/shake-rattle-and-roll/archive/master.zip). Inside the zip file you will find the following files: `index.html`, `style.css` and `index.js`. All of the changes will be made to the `index.js` file. **Do NOT change the `index.html` or `style.css` files.**
2. Retrieve the first box by using its `id`.
3. Add the classes `shake`, `animated`, and `infinite` to the first box.
4. Add the text "Shake" to the first box.
5. Retrieve the second box by using the class `rattle`.
6. Remove the class `rattle` from the second box.
7. Add the class `wobble` to the second box.
8. Update the text of the second box to "Wobble".
9. Retrieve the third box (**NOTE:** You will not be able to use a class).  
10. Add the class `rollIn` to the third box.
11. Add the text "Roll" to the third box.
12. Retrieve the four box using the `data-animation` attribute.
13. Add a class to the four box with the same value as the `data-animation` attribute. **Do NOT "hard code" the string.**
14. Retrieve the five box, then choose your own animation and make the box animate forever (See [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)).
15. Once completed, submit the `index.js` file to **Shake, Rattle and Roll** assignment on Brightspace.
